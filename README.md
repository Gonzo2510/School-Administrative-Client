There is a navigation bar located near the top of the page to allow the user to switch between views. The user can easily click on the Students tab, and all the available students will be shown. A search bar is available for the user to filter by student name. Within the Courses view, all the courses and the data associated with each course, such as the name, description, instructor, department, and the students currently enrolled in that class, are displayed. The Instructors tab shows the instructors alphabetized by name along with the courses they teach. The Register tab allows the user to create a new student by typing in their name and email.
